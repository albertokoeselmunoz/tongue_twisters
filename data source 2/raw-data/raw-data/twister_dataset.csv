"Shrewd Simon Short sewed shoes. Seventeen summers saw Simon's small, shabby shop still standing, saw Simon's selfsame squeaking sign still swinging swiftly, specifying: Simon Short, Smithfield's sole surviving shoemaker. Shoes soled. Sewed Superfinely. Simon's spouse, Sally Short, sewed sheets, stitched shirts, stuffed sofas. Simons stout sturdy sons—Stephen, Samuel, Saul, Silas—sold sundries. Stephen sold silks, satins, shawls. Samuel sold saddles, stirrups. Saul sold silver spoons, specialties. Silas sold Sally Short's stuffed sofas. Simon's second son, Samuel, saw Sophia Sophronia Spriggs somewhere. Sweet, sensible, smart Sophia Sophronia Spriggs. Sam soon showed strange symptoms. Surprisingly, Sam sighed sorrowfully, sang several serenades slyly, sought Sophia Spriggs' society, seldom stood selling saddles. Simon stormed, scowled severely, said, ""Sam seems so silly singing such senseless songs."". ""Softly,"" said sweet Sally. ""Sam's smitten. Sam's spied some sweetheart."" ""Smitten!"" snarled Simon. ""Scatterbrained simpleton! Sentimental, silly schoolboy"" Sally sighed sadly. Summoning Sam, she spoke sympathizingly. ""Sam,"" said she, ""Sire* seems singularly snappish. So, Sonny, stop strolling streets so soberly, stop singing sly serenades. Sell saddles sensibly, Sam. See Sophia Sophronia Spriggs speedily."" ""So soon?"" said Sam, startled. ""So soon, surely,"" said Sally, smilingly, ""specially since Sire shows such spirit."" So Sam, somewhat scared, sauntered slowly store- ward, shaking stupendously. ""Sophia Sophronia Spriggs . . . Sam Short's spouse . . . sounds splendid,"" said Sam softly. Sam soon spied Sophia starching shirts, singing softly. Seeing Sam, she stopped, saluting Sam smilingly. Sam stuttered shockingly. ""Sp-sp-splendid s-s-sum- mer s-s-season, So-So-Sophia."" ""Somewhat sultry,"" suggested Sophia. ""S-s-sartin,"" said Sam. ""Still selling saddles, Sam?"" said Sophia. ""S-s-sartin,"" said Sam. Silence, seventeen seconds. ""Sire shot sixteen snipe Saturday, Sam,"" said Sophia. Silence, seventy-seven seconds. ""See sister Sue's sunflowers,"" said Sophia socially, stopping such stiff silence. Such sprightly sauciness stimulated Sam strangely. So, swiftly speaking, Sam said, ""Sue's simflowers seem saying, 'Sophia Sophronia Spriggs, Samuel Short stroll serenely, seek some sparkling streams, sing some sweet, soul-stirring strain. . . .'"" Sophia snickered, so Sam stopped. She stood silently several seconds. Said Sam, ""Stop smiling, Sophia. Sam's seeking some sweet spouse!"" She still stood silently. ""Speak, Sophia, speak! Such silence speculates sor- row."" ""Seek Sire Spriggs, Sam,"" said Sophia. Sam sought Sire Spriggs. Sire Spriggs said, ""Sartin.""",[SH R UW1 D] [S AY1 M AH0 N] [SH AO1 R T] [S OW1 D] [SH UW1 Z] [.] [S EH1 V AH0 N T IY1 N] [S AH1 M ER0 Z] [S AO1] [S AY1 M AH0 N Z] [S M AO1 L]  [SH AE1 B IY0] [SH AA1
